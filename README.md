## How Requirements Are Met

### **1. Navigation Between Screens**
- The app includes multiple screens: 
  - **Login/Register Page** for user authentication.
  - **Listings Page** for browsing properties.
  - **Add Listing Page** for adding new properties.
  - **User Profile Page** for managing user details.
- Navigation is implemented using **Navigator** and **Routes**, ensuring smooth transitions between screens.

### **2. Dialogs and Pickers**
- **Dialogs**:
  - Used for **user registration** in the `Register.dart` dialog.
  - Used for **username updates** on the User Profile Page.
- **Pickers**:
  - Location picker integrated using the `FlutterMap` package to select property locations.

### **3. Notifications**
- The app includes **real-time notifications** for bid updates using `flutter_local_notifications`.
- Notifications are designed to alert users about essential updates (e.g., changes in the highest bid for a property).
- Proper configuration and handling of notification permissions are implemented.

### **4. Snackbars**
- **Snackbars** are used for brief, non-intrusive feedback:
  - On successful login/logout.
  - To confirm successful property additions or bid placements.
  - To notify users about invalid inputs or errors (e.g., empty fields).

### **5. Local Storage**
- Local storage is implemented using the `SharedPreferences` package:
  - Stores search history, making it easily retrievable for users.
  - Maintains application settings persistently.
- The app also includes functionality to reset and populate Firebase data using a local CSV file through `firebase_clear_and_import.dart`.

### **6. Cloud Storage**
- **Firebase Firestore** is used for cloud storage:
  - Stores property listings, user profiles, and bid information.
  - Data is retrieved efficiently using Firestore queries and streams.
- Firebase setup is correctly configured for Android and web platforms.

### **7. HTTP Requests**
- **External API Interaction**:
  - OpenStreetMap tile layers are integrated for property location display using HTTP requests.
- **Error Handling**:
  - All API calls include error-handling mechanisms to ensure the app remains robust under network issues or invalid data.
